This analysis explores price and cost differences in different regions for drugs and procedures covered under Medicare in 2014.

Specifically, I looked at price and cost differences for the top 10 most frequently completed procedures and prescribed drugs 
in the top 10 regions with the most overall procedures and drug prescriptions. 

The visualizations focus on a comparison between the top 10 most expensive and cheapest drug/procedures, comparing price/cost
for the same procedure in the most expensive and the cheapest region. 

We also included the total volume of prescription claims and number of discharges, which are depicted as line graphs, to include
volume, a potential determinant of price/cost.

The analysis was done by querying the public Medicare Dataset available on Google BigQuery.
